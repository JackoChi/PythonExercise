I first clean the data, which includes read the surveys, convert columns to numeric, condense datasets and combine the datasets.
I, then, analyse the correlation between sat scores and some demographic characters such as races and gender. 
The results look like there is a strong correlation between sat score and races and safety of school environment. 
However, if we dig more deeply, it turns out that the difference school funding and financial support has a huge impact behind that.

我首先清理数据，其中包括读取调查，将列转换为数字，浓缩数据集并合并数据集。然后，我分析sat分数与某些人口统计学特征（如种族和性别）之间的相关性。
结果看起来好像SAT分数与种族和学校环境安全之间有很强的相关性。但是，如果我们深入挖掘，结果显示学校资金和财政支持的差异对此背后产生了巨大影响。
