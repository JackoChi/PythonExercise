The team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. 
They surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses。

I've cleaned up the data, renamed several columns, and computed the average ranking of each movie. 
As I expected, it looks like the "original" movies are rated much more highly than the newer ones.
Secondly, It appears that the original movies were seen by more respondents than the newer movies. 
This reinforces what we saw in the rankings, where the earlier movies seem to be more popular.
Lastly, more males watches episodes 1-3, but males liked them far less than females did.

我清理了数据，重新命名了几个专栏，并计算了每部电影的平均排名。正如我所料，最早期的星战三部曲的评级要高于新电影。
其次，看起来老的电影被更多的受访者看到，而不是更新的电影。这加强了我们在排名中看到的，早期电影似乎更受欢迎。
最后，更多的男性观看1-3集，但男性喜欢他们远远少于女性。
